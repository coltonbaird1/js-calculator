Calculator App Idea
How to:

1. create the look of the calculator using html and css
2. use JS to make it functional
   2a. create three variables: num1, num2, and operator
   2b. create an onclick event for each of the buttons on the calculator that stores the number of the button clicked into
   num1
   2c. once num1 === true, create an onclick event for each of the operator buttons that stores the next clicked
   button into operator variables
   2d. once operator === true, create an onclick event for each of the buttons that stores the next clicked button into
   num2 variables
   2e. create a function that takes three arguments: num1, num2, and operator.
   2e1. if else chain to catch each operator:
   if (operator === /) {
   num1 / num 2;
   } else if (operator === +) {
   num1 + num 2;
   } else if (operator === -) {
   num1 - num 2;
   } else if (operator === _) {
   num1 _ num 2;
   };
